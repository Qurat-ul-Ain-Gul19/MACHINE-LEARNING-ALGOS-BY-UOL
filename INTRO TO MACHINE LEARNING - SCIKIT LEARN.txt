INTRO TO MACHINE LEARNING -SKIKIT LEARN

MACHINE LEARNING  TYPES:
1.SUPERVISED LEARNING (mostly image classification tasks)
***CLASSIFICATION***
...fraud detection
...emailspam detection
...diagnostics

***REGRESSION***
Risk assesment
some prediction

2.UNSUPERVISED LEARNING(only function is given through which model solves and predicts)
***DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION***
...face recognition
...text mining
...big data visualization
...image recognition

***CLUSTERING***
...biology
...city planing
...Targeted marketing 

**KNN,PCA**

3.REINFORCEMENT LEARNING(robotics, applied machine learning)
...Gaming
...finance sector
...manufacturing
...inventory management 
...robot navigation	

MACHINE LEARNING Algorithms

*****SUPERVISED
1.CLASSIFICATION
....Naive Bayies
..SVM..support vector machine
..Random decision forest

2.REGRESSION
...liner regression
...logistic regression
...genarlised regression

*****UNSUPERVISED 
1.CLUSTERING
...K means
...KNN
2.DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION
...PCA
...SVD...SUPPORt vector decision

*****REINFORCEMENT
...Brute Force
...Approximate Dynamic Programming
...Markov Decsion process

*****RECOMMENDER SYSTEM (recommendation system like that of NETFLIX)
...Cold start
...collaborative filtering
...item item collaborative filtering
...preference eliciation
...similarity search


MACHINE LEARNING PROCESS PIPELINE:
1.Prepare data
2.train model
3.package model
4.validate model
5.deploy model
6.monitor model

TRANSFER LEARNING
big data(in tera bytes)
..here we do distributive computing
..cluster of computers
...pyspark library
..all computers connected either through secure shell or netwrok or local 
...all data devided into further computers
